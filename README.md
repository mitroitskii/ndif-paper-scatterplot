# A set of plots for "NNSIGHT AND NDIF: DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS TO FOUNDATION MODEL INTERNALS"

The papers are extracted from [Ferrando et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00208") as `papers.csv` via `extract_papers.ipynb`. The list of papers was then manually curated and annotated with the final results in `papers_with_models.csv`. The plots are generated in `plots.ipynb`.
